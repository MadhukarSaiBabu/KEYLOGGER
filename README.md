# KEYLOGGER

The Keylogger project is a software application designed to record and log keyboard activity for analytical purposes. By capturing user input, it offers valuable insights into typing behavior, user interaction patterns, and potential security vulnerabilities. This project serves as an educational tool to understand how keylogging mechanisms work and how they can be identified or mitigated in cybersecurity contexts. It emphasizes the importance of ethical implementation, ensuring that user privacy is respected and that the tool is used solely for responsible, authorized, and educational purposes. The project contributes to a deeper understanding of both offensive and defensive aspects of digital security.
