# KEYLOGGER
The keylogger project is a software application that records and logs keyboard activity, capturing user input for analysis. It can provide insights into typing behavior, usage patterns, and potential security risks. However, its implementation requires careful consideration of ethical concerns and user privacy to ensure responsible usage.
